**Cerebral-Palsy-Adaptor**
This is the SolidWorks work for the Adaptor project, a project by myself and my colleagues aimed to turn signals from common sensors for children with limited mobility (i.e buttons, switches, joysticks, eye tracking, etc.) into common movements that will assist them in daily life. We targeted household games, which is more essential than one might think, but our research has shown that playing games with non-mobility limited children and feeling as free as possible is very important in the development of both general life and the effects of Cerebral Palsy. It has been shown that learned helplessness will take effect the more that these children view themselves as "unable," leading to real effects in how much their movement/abilities are affected by the disease. The arduino code, demos, and videos will be coming soon when the project is completed in May 2024!
